Hi, I'm [Your Name] 👋
I'm a passionate developer and programming streamer who loves to "roll your own" solutions, though I know not to roll my own Auth!
I believe the best way to learn is by diving deep into projects and solving problems from the ground up. I primarily work in C#, and one of my proudest projects is my custom data-driven game engine, AterraEngine, built in C# with Raylib.cs for rendering. It's designed to be mod-capable right out of the box.

- 🚀 Featured Project: [AterraEngine](https://github.com/AterraEngine/aterra_engine-cs) is a data-driven, mod-capable game engine written in C# using Raylib.cs for rendering. It’s designed to be lightweight yet powerful, enabling easy modding for users. Want to take a peek? Check out the AterraEngine repository to see what it's all about!
- 🧠 Learning Journey: I aim to keep my skillset diverse, dabbling in a bit of everything, as I believe the best way to grow as a developer is by learning widely.
- 🎮 Current Goal: My main focus is creating a small platformer game using AterraEngine. Keeping the scope limited helps me dive deep into game dev while managing my time effectively.
- 🌐 Web Dev: I also explore the world of web development using Blazor in C# to build interactive websites.

🎥 Streaming
On my twitch streams, [AndreasSasDev](https://www.twitch.tv/andreassasdev), you can find me doing a lot of live coding, whether it's building new features, debugging, or answering questions from viewers. 
My chat is like my very own rubber ducky — you know, for explaining code in true "rubber duck debugging" fashion 🦆.
If you enjoy coding with a community, learning alongside others, or just want to hang out while I debug, come by and say hi!

💡 Tech Stack & Tools
Languages: C#, TypeScript
Frameworks & Libraries: Blazor, Raylib.cs
Tools: Jetbrains Rider, Obsidian (I even built a plugin for it! [Colored Tags Wrangler](https://github.com/code-of-chaos/obsidian-colored_tags_wrangler))

🐤 Fun Fact
My whole streaming brand is based around rubber duckies, a nod to the well-known programming practice of rubber duck debugging — where you explain your code to a rubber duck to help figure out problems.
My viewers act as my chat-duckies, helping me along the way, and them helping me!
